tsm is a commandline tool for managing time series.

A time series is a set of key-value pairs, where the key is a time or
date and the value is a double or string.

Typical time series might be daily readings of an electric meter, the
reading on the bathroom scale in the morning, water level in a pond,
or periodic temperature readings.

Below are the (presumed) results of running "tsm -h".

  Version  0.1

  tsm [flags]
  tsm series
  tsm series <value>
  tsm series [-v] config|edit|init|plot

      -v   verbose output
      -V   print version number and exit
      -h   print this help message
      -d   use date rather than current date
      -D   when used with init, indicates the series is cumulative
           (i.e., the data is the difference between successive points)
      -L   list available series (with -v, show more info)
      -C   list available commands that act on a series

      series  is a time series name.  By itself, prints the last few values
              of the series.  If it is followed by a value, that value is
              assigned to the date (default is today, cf. -d).

      config  display series configuration (with -v, include comments)
      edit    permit editing of series configuration
      init    initializes a new time series
      plot    plots the named time series

      Examples:
              $ tsm temp init          # Create the time series calle temp
	      $ tsm temp -d -1 21.7    # It was 21.7 degrees yesterday (-1 days from now)
              $ tsm temp 22.3          # It is 22.3 degrees today
              $ tsm temp               # will print today's date and temperature
              $ tsm plot               # will plot the temperature history


To install, compile and copy tsm to somewhere on your PATH and source
bash_tsm from your .bashrc (in order to get bash completion).

The plotting features depend on gnuplot.
